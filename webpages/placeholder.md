I've been hosting this website http://buoy.hopto.org/ since 11-20, but I do not think I will continue to host the website just for 3 light pages. The experiment was definitely fun, but I think I have other uses for my Rpi 3B+, so I am just uploading the 3 html files i created, which were designed to use as few bytes as possible (under 1KB, some less than 512bytes). So if the site is down just know there were only a couple pages.
