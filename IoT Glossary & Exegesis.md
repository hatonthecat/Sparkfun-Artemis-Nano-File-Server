This is a Glossary of IoT terms I have encountered, in order of first encounter.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Internet of Things- devices that connect to the internet, typically without a face or human interface device. There are so many of them, someone foresaw the need for IPv6 addresses.

Ubiquitous Computing - Computing that's everywhere. Enough said? That was a joke.

Ambient Computing -used interchangeably with "ubiquitous computing"- using a computer that is so quiet one doesn't realize they are using one. See Brian Eno's Music For Airports: http://slashseconds.org/issues/001/001/articles/11_psuchin/index.php

Energy-scavenging - it looks for power in the nearby environment, used in an anthropomorphic and imperfect analogy. 

Energy-harvesting - able to produce power locally/off-grid to power the device (agnostic as to partially or totally), as if it is some kind of farmer (also anthropomorphic, incongruously compares months of work into hours or minutes, if comparing the time it takes to grow food crops to generate power from a photovoltaic panel or thermoelectric generator)

Energy-autarkic- similar to energy-scavenging and harvesting, but more specifically reveals/indicates that the device requires no external charging, or possibly even batteries (as with capacitors/li-ion capacitors). It also is the least personified. This does not refer to the energy needed to manufacture the device, which a given, but post-imaging of the binary and once it is in a "production environment."

For the technically minded, I prefer the 3rd -"autarkic" because it sounds more "correct" (depending on the application), but for those explaining to the non-technical, and for those applications/users that are agnostic, or lazy, you can use the the first two.

Pervasive Computing - What? Seriously?? 
This is a blend of two concepts- ambient computing- computing that is available under the threshold of awareness, and ubiquitous computing- computing that is everywhere and is being used all the time, because it is impossible to know if it is even on and where they are scattered, like land mines from WWII.
Proceed cautiously and be mindful of the environment when developing new products. Please do not use the words "disposable" and "electronics" in the same sentence. 
This paper explains the term better than I can:

p.6 "The single location metrics show the requirements to deploy an instance of each application, while the pervasive metric assumes that the application is deployed at scale in its target environment." 

Additional projections: "When NVIDIA purchased mobile-chip designer Arm Holdings from SoftBank last year, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang made the bold prediction that in the years ahead, there will be trillions of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) devices." https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2021/7/253454-a-battery-free-internet-of-things/abstract

For wireless networks, using too little throughput requires the device to be running constantly. Using too much throughput increases the storage requirements. Having a balance of economy and conciseness of information transfer should be a goal of communication protocols that transmit essential services.

Autarkic computing can be used as a counterbalance to pervasive computing, if, and only, it is not scaled up to unsustainable levels. Imagine, on a quadrant of of low and high bandwidth and power. Say, in Quadrant I and IV, you have high bittrate, but Quadrant I is irrespective of power consumption. Quadrant II and III is low bittrate, also irrespective of power consumption. Quadrant III is low power consumption, and Quadrant IV is high power consumption. Thus, the Positive X-axis is high data throughput, and the positive Y axis is high power consumption. Autarkic Computing could be used to operate in Quadrant III, whereas improvements in transistor nodes (Moore's Law), increases in throughput could relatively place more throughput currently in Quadrant I, II and IV into Quadrant III over time. 

IoT - Internet of Things is a curious choice of words, even though it is a plainly obvious meaning. Why not "Internet of People"? Perhaps since there is already hardware for "people," there is less of a need to emphasize user interfaces. It would be interesting to develop this project as part of a story. The book Foucault's Pendulum, by Umberto Eco, comes to mind. What if the purpose of this project, were a reaction to the Internet of Things? For example, if I wanted to bet that IoT devices will be manufactured in the billions a decade from now, then it would be somewhat reasonable to develop a guarded view that IoT may end up taking over our way of life, for better or worse. Obviously, IoT devices are in their infancy right now (in 2022), and have no advanced AI, even if a cloud is able to gather substantial data. Therefore, the motivation of this project is to begin a playful competition between IfT- the Internet <i>for</i> things, and IfP- Internet for <i>people</i>. 

There are multiple ways one can embark on this project. The first, is to do nothing, and to wait patiently for 10 years, and then to panic if a swarm of IoT devices amassed a hive mind and developed Artificial General Intelligence.

Another option is to begin developing arbitrary and useful software that humans can understand- layman tutorials, so that if IoT devices ever developed superintelligence, humans would have substantially more hacking tools to modify the firmware of a number of microcontrollers. If IoT devices are invading the consciousness, then programming IoT devices is the counterinsurgency. As developing and producing IoT devices becomes more popular/accessible, the demand for IoT devices could shift from being used to serve large organizations to serving individuals or the collective. I am reminded of the 2007 game BioShock by 2K Games (not the weird Infinite Sequel), where parts are unlocked for hacking vending machines and reverse-programming drones. If there are no tools to do this in 2032, how helpless will humanity be in Rapture?
