This is a Glossary of IoT terms I have encountered, in order of first encounter.

Internet of Things- devices that connect to the internet, typically without a face or human interface device. There are so many of them, someone foresaw the need for IPv6 addresses.

Ubiquitous Computing - computing that's everywhere. Enough said? That was a joke.

Ambient Computing -used interchangeably with "ubiquitous computing"- using a computer that is so quiet one doesn't realize they are using one. See Brian Eno's Music For Airports: http://slashseconds.org/issues/001/001/articles/11_psuchin/index.php

Energy-scavenging - it looks for power in the nearby environement, used in an anthropomorphic and imperfect analogy

Energy-harvesting - able to produce power locally/off-grid to power the device (partially or totally)

Energy-autarkic- similar to energy-scavenging and harvesting, but more specifically reveals/indicates that the device requires no batteries.

Pervasive Computing - What? Seriously?? 
This is a blend of two concepts- ambient computing- computing that is available under the threshold of awarenes, and ubiquitous computing- computing that is everywhere and is being used all the time, because it is impossible to know if it is even on and where they are scattered, like land mines from WWII.
Proceed cautiously and be mindful of the environment. 
This paper explains the term better than I can:

p.6 "The single location metrics show the requirements to deploy an instance of each application, while the pervasive metric assumes that the application is deployed at scaled in its target environment." 

For wireless networks, using too little throughput requires the device to be running constantly. Using too much throughput increases the storage requirements. Having a balance of economical and conciseness of information transfer should be a goal of communication protocols that transmit essential services.
