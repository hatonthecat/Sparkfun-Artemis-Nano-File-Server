I used this guide: https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/hookup-guide-for-the-sparkfun-redboard-artemis-nano 

It has a lot of useful info. 

Fortunately, I did not have to buy a USB to Serial cable- this board has a CH340E chip, which has built in USB to Serial IC (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter)

so I can use any USB-C to USB-A to my PC. 

In my case, I  used a micro B USB adapter  https://www.adafruit.com/product/4299 which does the trick too.  

I was afraid my USB-C cables had more current so with this at least it won't be more than 5V.

I also have a Powerjive Usb Voltage/Amps Power Meter Tester Multimeter https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013FANC9W 

It is displaying 301mAh and 4.95V, with PWR (red LED), CHG (yellow LED) and bluetooth (blue LED) which normally blinks.

Not sure about that yellow light, but I will monitor it. 

I read somewhere it switches to 300mA if it receieves too much current? The yellow light isn't on all the time. Now the yellow light is off (after about 40 minutes).

The device manager shows the USB installed with the correct VID 0x1A86:

Setting up Arduino IDE

From SparkFun website:

"Note: The Arduino core for the Apollo3 (i.e. the board definitions) is only compatible up to release 1.8.12." 

https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/artemis-development-with-the-arduino-ide/setting-up-the-arduino-ide

I will go with the 1.8.12. (I hadn't realized I already Installed 2.0.2 already, but oh well, I have space for 2).
https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/OldSoftwareReleases#previous 

https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/starting-guide/cores

https://downloads.arduino.cc/arduino-1.8.12-windows.exe 

When prompted if I wanted to install a new version of Arduino, I selected "No" (since the Sparkfun page  hasn't been updated regarding compatibility for newer IDES for the Apollo3).
